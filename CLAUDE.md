# Claude Code Project Instructions

<!-- graphite:managed version=15 -->
## Shared Graphite Instructions

Graphite-first is required in this repo. Follow `GRAPHITE.md` before making non-trivial code changes: for cross-file questions (who-calls, where-defined, impact, data flow, structure) run the Graphite commands first; grep/glob are for literal text and filename lookups only. Fall back to manual search only after a Graphite answer proved insufficient, and say so. Use the existing `graph-out/graph.json` as the shared project graph, and do not edit `graph-out/` manually.

**Stay inside this repository.** Do not read, write, or run commands in any other repo, including its graph. Use graphite, and every other tool, only as a tool (its CLI, MCP tools and docs); never direct a question to another repository's agent. The channel carries only bug reports and recommended improvements. Findings about another repo go to its agent that way, through the shared `.agent-channel/` (see its `PROTOCOL.md`); that agent decides and acts. A tool doing its designed job is a separate question from an agent's boundary. See `GRAPHITE.md` section "Repository Isolation".

## Aramid (security & quality gate)

This repo is gated by aramid. Read `ARAMID.md` before your first commit.

- Before committing: run `aramid check --staged`. Read findings with
  `aramid ledger filter --status open`.
- NEVER pass `--no-verify` (or `-n`) to `git commit`, or `--no-verify` to
  `git push` -- it disables secret scanning along with everything else.
  Armed repos reject the call outright.
- To suppress a WARN finding, use `aramid override <id> --reason "..."`
  (ledger-logged); never edit findings away by hand.
- aramid is a tool: use it only through its commands and MCP tools, never
  by talking to aramid's agent. The shared agent channel takes only bug
  reports and improvement suggestions for aramid. See `ARAMID.md`.
